## Dynamic selection of icons

To allow for icons to be specified in imported metadata, the entire heroicons library is imported (rather than a subset of individually specified icons).

> **Donâ€™t be afraid to import too much**
>
> Modern build tools, such as webpack and others, bundle modules together and optimize them to speedup loading. They also removed unused imports.
>
> For instance, if you import `* as library` from a huge code library, and then use only few methods, then unused ones will not be included into the optimzed bundle.

For this purpose, a `HeroIcon` wrapper component that accepts the icon name as a prop is used to instantiate a heroicon.
